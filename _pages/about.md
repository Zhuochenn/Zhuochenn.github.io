I am a `Ph.D. candidate` in the [Robot Perception Lab(RPL)](https://kings-rpl.github.io/), supervised by Prof. [Shan Luo](https://shanluo.github.io/). I am also a research intern at Noah's Ark Lab, London, supervised by Dr. [Jiankang Deng](https://jiankangdeng.github.io/). My passion lies in endowing robots with generalizable and explainable tactile sensing abilities akin to those of humans. My Ph.D. research primarily focuses on overcoming challenges in vision-based tactile sensors and contact-rich robot grasping and manipulation tasks using learning-based methods, including generative learning, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning.

Before starting my Ph.D., I spent a year as a fully-funded visiting student at the National University of Singapore, conducting research on Manta Ray robots, supervised by Prof. [Chew Chee-Meng](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=woLCMSYAAAAJ&hl=en). I obtained my master's degree from Xiamen University, where my research interests included the simulation, fabrication, and verification of flexible tactile sensors and their applications in robotics.
